/**
 * Outreach Cadence + Follow-Up Logic — netlify/functions/_shared/outreach.js
 *
 * Provides:
 * - Standard outreach cadence timeline (day 0 → day 7 → day 14 → stale)
 * - Outreach tracking defaults (what was sent, when, response status)
 * - Follow-up draft builders (referral ask, first follow-up, second follow-up)
 * - Utility helpers for "follow-ups due today" and "outreach overdue"
 * - Response rate analysis (with outreach vs without outreach)
 *
 * Rules:
 * - Do NOT auto-send anything. All drafts are for manual copy-paste only.
 * - No LinkedIn scraping. No browser automation. No approval weakening.
 * - Approval gate is untouched.

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out because I noticed a ${title} opportunity at ${company} that looks like a strong match for my background.

As you know, I have been working as a ${laneLabel} and I have [X] years of experience in [key skill relevant to the role]. This role looks well-aligned with what I've been building toward.

Would you be open to referring me, or putting me in touch with the hiring manager? I've already applied through the official channel — a referral or warm introduction would make a real difference.

I'll make it easy — happy to send you a short note you could forward, or just a link to my application. Whatever works for you.

No pressure at all, and thank you for considering it.

Kind regards,
Samiha Chowdhury`;

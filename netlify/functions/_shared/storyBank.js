The challenge was not just the technical complexity but the regulatory environment: every change required security review, compliance sign-off, and change control documentation. I built a governance structure that included weekly programme board meetings, a living risk register with clear owners and mitigation plans, and a phased delivery approach that kept the existing system running during the transition. I personally drove the alignment between the engineering team, the federal compliance officers who had audit authority over the timeline, and the vendor team. When a compliance review threatened to delay go-live by six weeks, I facilitated a structured review session that clarified the specific concerns, produced a targeted evidence package, and unlocked approval within two weeks.

Each phase had defined success criteria before we moved forward. The test migration phase was critical — we ran two full test migrations before go-live, using the first to surface data integrity issues in legacy asset records, and the second to validate our remediation. By the time we reached production cutover, we had high confidence in the data quality. The go-live itself was managed as a structured cutover with a parallel run period, clear rollback criteria, and hypercare support for the first 30 days post-go-live.

    action: 'I ran a structured delivery retrospective to surface the real blockers: three main issues emerged — unclear definition of done causing rework at the end of sprints, manual deployment steps adding unpredictable time, and sprint planning sessions that were too long and insufficiently focused. I redesigned the sprint ceremonies (tighter planning with pre-prepared backlog items, structured retrospectives with action owners), worked with the engineering lead to introduce CI/CD pipeline improvements that automated the manual deployment steps, and clarified the definition of done with the product owner. I tracked velocity metrics weekly and reported progress to stakeholders.',

I took a structured diagnostic approach: I ran a detailed retrospective, mapped the current delivery workflow step by step, and had individual conversations with the engineers and product owner to understand where they felt the most friction. The three root causes were clear: sprint planning without sufficient backlog preparation, a release process with manual steps that nobody owned end-to-end, and a definition of done that was interpreted differently by different team members. I addressed each systematically. For planning, I introduced a pre-planning backlog grooming session so that by the time we reached sprint planning, the top items were already well-defined. For release, I worked with the engineering lead to build a CI/CD pipeline that automated the three most time-consuming manual steps.

I then ran a structured joint session where I presented a shared view of the programme constraints — timeline, scope, compliance requirements — and facilitated a discussion that moved from competing demands to shared tradeoff decisions.

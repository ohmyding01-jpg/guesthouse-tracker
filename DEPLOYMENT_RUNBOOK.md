# Deployment Runbook

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- A Netlify account
- (For production) A Supabase project

---

## 1. Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local dev server (demo mode, no backend needed)
VITE_DEMO_MODE=true npm run dev
# OR with netlify dev (required to test functions locally)
netlify dev
```

**Demo mode** (`VITE_DEMO_MODE=true`): Uses localStorage + pre-seeded data. No Supabase required. All scoring, classification, dedup, and approval flows are fully functional.

---

## 2. First Netlify Deploy (Demo/Preview)

### Via Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login
netlify login

# Link to a Netlify site (create new or link existing)
netlify sites:create --name job-search-os
# OR
netlify link

# Deploy preview
netlify deploy --dir dist --build

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --dir dist --build --prod
```

### Via GitHub Integration

1. Push this repo to GitHub
2. Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com) → New site from Git
3. Connect your GitHub repo
4. Build settings:
   - Build command: `npm install && npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`
   - Functions directory: `netlify/functions`
5. Add environment variable: `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true`
6. Deploy

**Demo mode will be fully functional immediately.** No Supabase credentials needed.

---

## 3. Production Mode (Supabase)

### 3a. Create Supabase Project

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → New Project
2. Note your project URL and keys

### 3b. Run Database Schema

In your Supabase SQL Editor, run the SQL from `DEPLOYMENT_DECISION.md` (Supabase Schema section).

### 3c. Set Netlify Environment Variables

In Netlify UI → Site settings → Environment variables, add:

| Variable | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `VITE_DEMO_MODE` | `false` | Enables live backend mode |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | `https://your-project.supabase.co` | From Supabase project settings |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | your service role key | Server-side only — never expose in frontend |
| `LIVE_INTAKE_ENABLED` | `false` | Keep OFF until sources verified |
| `MAX_RECORDS_PER_RUN` | `50` | Conservative cap per scheduled run |

### 3d. Redeploy

```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

---

## 4. Enabling Live Source Intake

> **WARNING:** Only enable after you have verified your RSS/API sources return valid structured data.

1. Set `LIVE_INTAKE_ENABLED=true` in Netlify environment variables
2. Go to Sources page → enable individual RSS/API sources (start with `src-rss-seek` only)
3. The scheduled function (`ingest-scheduled`) runs every 2 hours automatically
4. Monitor the Sources page for ingestion health, failure counts, and High Review percentage
5. If a source shows a "Noisy source" warning (>50% low-fit records), disable it and review

**Kill switch:** Set `LIVE_INTAKE_ENABLED=false` and redeploy to immediately stop all automated intake.

### First Live Source: Greenhouse (Recommended)

**Greenhouse is the recommended first live source** (see `LIVE_ACTIVATION_RUNBOOK.md` for the complete one-source rollout checklist).

Greenhouse is preferred over SEEK RSS because the API returns structured JSON with reliable job IDs, making dedup and Apply Pack URL flow more reliable.

**Steps:**
1. Confirm `LIVE_INTAKE_ENABLED=true`, `MAX_RECORDS_PER_RUN=50`, and `DISCOVERY_SECRET` are set
2. Set `GREENHOUSE_BOARDS` to 2–3 company board tokens (e.g. `atlassian,servicenow`)
3. In the Sources page, click **Enable** next to "Greenhouse Job Boards (configured companies)"
4. Trigger a manual discovery run: `curl -X POST https://your-site/.netlify/functions/discover -H "X-Discovery-Secret: your-secret" -d '{}'`
5. Verify in the Sources page: Last Run timestamp updated, Imported count > 0, no failures
6. Verify in the Discovered Jobs view: new records appear with correct lane/score
7. Check that generic Ops/PM roles score below 70 and are NOT recommended
8. After verifying dedup (second run shows 0 new records), proceed to approve strong-fit records
9. After 48h, check High Review % — if >50%, review the board token list

**Do NOT enable yet:**
- Email intake (`src-rss-linkedin-jobs`) — requires email forwarding setup
- Multiple live sources simultaneously — enable one at a time

See `LIVE_ACTIVATION_RUNBOOK.md` for a detailed activation checklist, verification steps, and rollback procedure.

---

## 5. Scheduled Functions

Netlify Scheduled Functions are enabled automatically when deployed. They require:
- A paid Netlify plan OR Netlify free tier with scheduled functions enabled
- The `netlify.toml` `[functions]` config is already set

| Function | Schedule | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ingest-scheduled` | Every 2 hours | Runs live sources (if enabled) |
| `stale-scan-scheduled` | Daily 08:00 UTC | Flags stale/ghosted opportunities |

To test scheduled functions locally:
```bash
netlify functions:invoke ingest-scheduled
netlify functions:invoke stale-scan-scheduled
```

---

## 6. API Endpoints (Netlify Functions)

All endpoints are at `/.netlify/functions/[name]`.

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/opportunities` | GET | List opportunities (with ?status=, ?lane=, ?recommended=) |
| `/opportunities` | POST | Manual single intake |
| `/opportunities?id=X` | PATCH | Update tracker fields |
| `/intake` | POST | Batch intake (CSV, RSS, API) |
| `/approve` | POST | Approve / reject / override |
| `/sources` | GET | List sources with health |
| `/sources` | PATCH | Toggle source enabled/disabled |
| `/csv-import` | POST | CSV text import |
| `/logs` | GET | List ingestion logs |

---

## 7. n8n Integration

If using n8n for orchestration:

- n8n workflows should call the API endpoints above
- n8n must NOT re-implement scoring/classification logic
- n8n must NOT bypass the approval gate (`/approve` is required before applying)
- Recommended workflow: scheduled trigger → POST `/intake` → results appear in approval queue

Example n8n HTTP request node:
```
URL: https://your-site.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/intake
Method: POST
Body: { "source": "src-rss-seek", "sourceType": "rss", "jobs": [...] }
```

---

## 8. Verification Checklist

### 8a. Demo Mode / Baseline

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Site loads in browser
- [ ] Demo mode indicator shows in header
- [ ] Dashboard shows 9 demo opportunities
- [ ] Approval Queue shows pending items
- [ ] Approving an item moves it to "approved" status
- [ ] CSV import adds new opportunities and deduplicates
- [ ] Manual intake adds and scores a new opportunity
- [ ] Sources page shows kill switch OFF
- [ ] Opportunity detail shows correct lane, score, signals
- [ ] TPM roles score higher than generic ops roles (verify in tracker)
- [ ] Stale opportunity flagged in demo data (Zip Co / demo-9)
- [ ] Audit trail visible after approve/reject

### 8b. Production Persistence (run `node scripts/verify.js` locally first)

- [ ] `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` set in Netlify UI
- [ ] `VITE_DEMO_MODE=false` set in Netlify UI
- [ ] Redeploy — header shows NO demo badge
- [ ] Create a manual opportunity → appears in Supabase `opportunities` table
- [ ] Approve the opportunity → `approval_state` = `approved` in Supabase
- [ ] Update status (e.g., `applied`) → `status` and `last_action_date` updated in Supabase
- [ ] Reload page — data persists (not lost on reload)

### 8c. Live Intake — One Source (SEEK RSS)

- [ ] `LIVE_INTAKE_ENABLED=true` set in Netlify UI
- [ ] `MAX_RECORDS_PER_RUN=50` set in Netlify UI
- [ ] Run `netlify functions:invoke ingest-scheduled` — exits without error
- [ ] Sources page: `src-rss-seek` shows Last Run timestamp and Imported count
- [ ] Approval Queue: new records from SEEK appear with `approval_state=pending`
- [ ] Run `ingest-scheduled` a second time — no new records inserted (dedup working)
- [ ] Verify at least one generic Ops/PM record is scored low and NOT recommended
- [ ] Verify no record was auto-approved (all approval_state = `pending`)
- [ ] Sources page: High Review count populated after sufficient runs

### 8d. Safety / Kill Switch

- [ ] Set `LIVE_INTAKE_ENABLED=false` → `netlify functions:invoke ingest-scheduled` logs "No live-capable sources enabled" and exits cleanly
- [ ] Manual intake and CSV still work with `LIVE_INTAKE_ENABLED=false`
- [ ] Stale scan runs independently of `LIVE_INTAKE_ENABLED`

### 8e. Scheduled Jobs

- [ ] Stale scan (`stale-scan-scheduled`) runs without errors: `netlify functions:invoke stale-scan-scheduled`
- [ ] After stale scan, opportunities with `status=applied` older than 21 days get `stale_flag=true`
- [ ] Stale scan does NOT auto-change status — only flags for human review

---

## 9. Blockers / Current State

### What requires external accounts:
- **Netlify account + site:** Required to deploy. CLI available.
- **Supabase project:** Required for production persistence. Not required for demo mode.
- **Live source credentials:** Not required for any currently supported sources (RSS is public).

### Exact blocker if deployment cannot complete:
**Netlify account credentials are not available in this automated build environment.** The repository is in a fully deploy-ready state. To deploy:
1. Connect the repository to a Netlify site via GitHub integration or `netlify deploy`
2. Set `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true` (already set in `netlify.toml`)
3. Deploy — the demo preview will be live and fully functional immediately

---

## 10. Resetting Demo Data

In the browser console or the Import page:
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('job-search-os-v1');
location.reload();
```

---

## 11. Apply Pack Automation Layer (v3.0.0)

### What is Automated Now

After approval, the system immediately:
1. Generates the Apply Pack (`apply_pack_generated` status)
2. Sets `needs_apply_url` if the role is manual external with no apply URL
3. Fires `apply_pack_generated` webhook event
4. Fires `strong_fit_ready_to_apply` webhook event if fit_score ≥ 75 and `recommended=true`

### Copy-Ready Blocks

The Apply Pack now includes two copy-ready draft assets:

**`copy_ready_summary_block`**
- A draft resume summary paragraph aligned to the specific lane and role
- Includes lane framing, key skills from JD, and role-specific context
- Always marked `[DRAFT — review and personalise before use]`
- NOT a final statement — requires human review and personalisation

**`copy_ready_resume_emphasis_block`**
- A formatted list of lead-with themes and proof points
- Structured as "LEAD-WITH THEMES" and "SURFACE THESE PROOF POINTS"
- Always marked `[DRAFT — direction for tailoring, not fabricated claims]`
- Designed to be copied into an editing workflow or notes

Access these in the **✍ Copy-Ready** tab of the Apply Pack page.

### Pack Readiness Score

A `Pack Readiness %` is computed and shown in the Apply Pack action bar.  
Factors: resume recommendation present, keywords, proof points, copy-ready blocks, apply URL, checklist progress, outreach draft.

### Human-Friendly Export

Two export options are available in the Apply Pack action bar:
- **📄 Export Text Pack** — downloads a human-readable `.txt` file with all pack content (role header, URLs, resume recommendation, summary block, emphasis block, keywords, proof points, outreach drafts, checklist, follow-up date)
- **⬇ Export Pack JSON** — downloads the full machine-readable JSON pack

### Workflow Status Progression

```
pending → approved → needs_apply_url (manual external, no URL) → ready_to_prepare
                   → apply_pack_generated (URL present)        → ready_to_apply → applied → follow_up_1 → ...
```

To advance from `needs_apply_url`: add the official apply URL via the banner in ApplyPack.jsx or OpportunityDetail.jsx. Status advances automatically to `apply_pack_generated`.

### Events Fired

| Event | When |
|-------|------|
| `apply_pack_generated` | Every approval that generates a pack |
| `strong_fit_ready_to_apply` | Approval where fit_score ≥ 75 and recommended=true |
| `new_strong_fit` | Discovery run finds a strong-fit opportunity |

Configure destinations via `WEBHOOK_URL` (catch-all) or `WEBHOOK_URL_<EVENT_NAME>` env vars.

### What Still Requires Manual Action

- Resume tailoring (system provides direction, not final file edits)
- Personalising outreach drafts (review required before sending)
- Selecting and submitting the application (never automated)
- Verifying the apply URL is the correct ATS link
- Replacing `[bracketed]` placeholders in copy-ready blocks

### Pack Regeneration

Pack can be regenerated via the **🔄 Regenerate Pack** button when status is `apply_pack_generated`, `ready_to_apply`, or `approved`. Regeneration:
- Preserves resume version override history
- Preserves checklist done-state
- Records new `pack_version` and `last_regenerated_at`
- Records whether apply URL was missing at generation time (`apply_url_missing_at_generation`)

---

## 12. Continuity + Persistence + Premium Usability Layer (v4.0.0)

### What's New

1. **Copy-Ready Cover Note Block** — `copy_ready_cover_note_block` is now generated in every Apply Pack. 3-paragraph professional draft, clearly marked `[DRAFT]`. Suitable for ATS text fields or email introductions.

2. **Pack Readiness Score — Persisted** — `pack_readiness_score` is now embedded in the pack object and persisted on the opportunity record (`pack_readiness_score` field). Score updates when pack is generated or regenerated. Used in dashboard/reporting to identify most-ready roles.

3. **Apply Pack Auto-Refresh on Apply URL Add** — When a role was approved without an apply URL (`apply_url_missing_at_generation = true`), adding the URL later now **automatically regenerates the pack** with the URL included. Override history, checklist progress, and audit trail are all preserved. `regeneration_reason = 'apply_url_added'` is recorded.

4. **Print / Save as PDF** — "🖨 Print / Save PDF" button calls `window.print()`. `@media print` CSS in `style.css` hides navigation chrome and formats the pack as a clean printable document.

5. **Server-Side Discovery Profile Persistence** — Profile is now persisted to Supabase via `/profile` endpoint.

### Migration Required

Run migration `003_user_preferences.sql` in Supabase to create the `user_preferences` table:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL editor or via migration CLI
-- supabase/migrations/003_user_preferences.sql
```

### Discovery Profile — Live Mode

In live mode, the discovery profile is loaded from `GET /.netlify/functions/profile` and saved via `POST /.netlify/functions/profile`. localStorage is kept as an offline cache/fallback. Demo mode continues to use localStorage only.

### Apply Pack Print View

The Apply Pack page now has a "🖨 Print / Save PDF" button. Clicking it opens the browser print dialog. The `@media print` CSS in `src/style.css` hides buttons, nav, and action bars, leaving only the pack content in a clean printable layout. Use the browser's "Save as PDF" option to produce a PDF.

### Exports Available (Apply Pack)

| Export | Format | Includes |
|---|---|---|
| 🖨 Print / Save PDF | Browser print / PDF | All visible pack content, print-formatted |
| 📄 Export Text Pack | `.txt` download | Role header, URLs, resume rec, all copy-ready blocks, keywords, checklist, follow-up date |
| ⬇ Export JSON | `.json` download | Full machine-readable pack |

### What Still Requires Manual Action

- Resume tailoring (system provides direction and copy-ready emphasis block)
- Cover note personalisation (replace bracketed placeholders with real experience)
- Application submission (never automated)
- Outreach sending (draft provided; sending requires human decision)
- Follow-up scheduling (system suggests date; user marks steps)

---

## Prioritization + Actionability Layer (v5.0)

### Readiness-Based Sorting (Tracker)

The Tracker now defaults to **Readiness sort** instead of fit score. This surfaces "Ready to Apply" roles at the top.

Sort options:
- 🎯 **Readiness** (default) — Ready → Follow-up Due → Needs URL → Needs Approval → In Progress → Low Priority
- ⭐ **Fit Score** — descending fit score
- 📋 **Status** — alphabetical status

Each row shows a **Readiness Badge** with a tooltip explaining the blocked state (e.g., "Blocked: apply URL not yet added").

### Action Center (Dashboard)

The Dashboard's first panel after the stats row is the **Action Center**. It lists up to 5 prioritized actions, e.g.:
- ✅ "2 roles are ready to apply now" → links to top-ready opportunity
- ⏰ "1 applied role needs follow-up" → links directly to the opportunity
- 🔗 "3 approved roles blocked — missing apply URL"
- ⭐ "2 high-fit roles waiting for approval"

Logic: `getBestNextActions(opps)` in `netlify/functions/_shared/readiness.js`.

### Weekly Digest — Readiness Summary

`GET /digest?type=weekly` now includes a `readiness` field:

```json
{
  "readiness": {
    "readyToApplyCount": 2,
    "highReadinessCount": 1,
    "blockedByMissingUrlCount": 3,
    "needsApprovalCount": 4,
    "appliedFollowUpDueCount": 1,
    "topReadyToApply": [...]
  }
}
```

### Profile Merge / Sync Safety

When you load the Discovery Profile page in live mode:
1. The system fetches both the **server profile** and **local profile**
2. If they differ, a conflict resolution panel appears
3. You choose: **Keep Server Profile** or **Keep Local Profile**
4. The chosen profile becomes the new source of truth in both locations

This prevents silent overwrites when using multiple devices or browsers.

### Print / Export Polish (Apply Pack)

Text export now includes:
- `Generated: [timestamp] — AI Job Search System (Samiha Chowdhury)` footer line

Browser print now:
- Sets `data-print-timestamp` attribute on `<html>` for `@page` footer
- `@page` CSS adds "AI Job Search System" footer and page numbers (in supporting browsers)
- `body::after` provides fallback footer for browsers without `@page` support

### New Shared Module

`netlify/functions/_shared/readiness.js` — exports:
- `classifyReadinessGroup(opp)` — returns one of 6 READINESS_GROUPS values
- `getReadinessReason(opp)` — human-readable blocked-state explanation
- `groupByReadiness(opps)` — groups and sorts array of opportunities
- `getBestNextActions(opps)` — Action Center action list
- `computeReadinessSummary(opps)` — digest-ready summary object
- `READINESS_GROUPS`, `READINESS_GROUP_LABELS`, `READINESS_GROUP_ORDER`

### What Still Requires Manual Action

All previous manual-only actions remain unchanged. The prioritization layer provides decision support, not automation:
- Application submission is never automated
- Approval remains mandatory for every role
- Readiness classification does not bypass any approval requirement

---

## v6.0 Changes — PWA + Approval Queue + Reports + Batch URL + History

### PWA / Installability

The app now satisfies PWA installability criteria.

Files added:
- `public/manifest.json` — Web App Manifest
- `public/sw.js` — Service Worker
- `public/icon-192.png` — 192×192 app icon
- `public/icon-512.png` — 512×512 app icon (also maskable)
- `public/apple-touch-icon.png` — 180×180 iOS icon

`index.html` now includes:
- `<link rel="manifest" href="/manifest.json">`
- `<meta name="theme-color" content="#1e3a5f">`
- `<link rel="apple-touch-icon" ...>`
- Service worker registration script

**Service worker caching strategy:**
- App shell (HTML/JS/CSS): Stale-While-Revalidate
- Fonts: Cache First
- Netlify Functions (all `/.netlify/functions/*`): Network Only — live data is never cached

**IMPORTANT:** If you update the app, increment `CACHE_NAME` in `public/sw.js` to bust the shell cache.

### Approval Queue Readiness Layer

`ApprovalQueue.jsx` now shows:
- ReadinessBadge per pending role (reason + score)
- Grouped tiers: High-Fit → Standard → Weak Fit
- Sort by Fit Score or Readiness
- Missing-URL warning inline per role
- Approval gate reminder remains unchanged

### Reports — Readiness Panel

New "Readiness Panel" tab added to `/reports` (default view).
Shows live readiness counts and role lists from `state.opportunities`.
No API call required — uses `computeReadinessSummary()` from `_shared/readiness.js`.

### Follow-up Alert Banner

`Dashboard.jsx` now shows a dismissable banner when any opportunity has `next_action_due` within the next 2 days. Banner is session-dismissed only (no localStorage persistence). No fake urgency.

### Batch Apply URL Add

`BatchUrlPanel.jsx` (new component) provides a multi-record URL input form:
- Only shows roles in NEEDS_APPLY_URL group
- Calls `updateApplyUrl()` per record (full auditability preserved)
- Surfaced in `Tracker.jsx` via a contextual banner when blocked roles exist

`api.js` exports: `batchUpdateApplyUrls(entries)`

### Readiness History

`api.js` exports:
- `recordReadinessHistory(oppId, eventType, payload)` — writes to localStorage (demo) or Supabase (live)
- `getReadinessHistory(oppId, limit)` — reads history

Supabase migration: `supabase/migrations/004_readiness_history.sql`

Events tracked: `status_changed`, `apply_url_added`, `pack_regenerated`, `approval_state_changed`, `readiness_score_changed`

### Verification

`scripts/verify.js` now has **465 tests** across **18 sections**.

Section 18 covers: manifest, service worker, icons, approval queue readiness, reports readiness panel, follow-up banner, batch URL panel, readiness history, hierarchy guard, approval guard.

Run: `node scripts/verify.js`

---

## v5.0 — Production-Hardening + Continuity Layer

### Deploy Blocker Fix (Reports.jsx)

`src/pages/Reports.jsx` had a duplicate `export default function Reports()` that caused Netlify build failures. The duplicate (the older version without ReadinessPanel) has been removed. The canonical version with ReadinessPanel, readiness digest type, and full weekly digest is preserved.

**Verification:** `grep -c "export default function" src/pages/Reports.jsx` must return `1`.

### Readiness History Wiring

All key call sites now automatically record readiness history:

| Function | Events recorded |
|---|---|
| `approveOpportunity()` | `approval_state_changed`, `status_changed`, `pack_regenerated` |
| `updateApplyUrl()` | `apply_url_added`, `readiness_score_changed`, `pack_regenerated` |
| `updateApplyStatus()` | `status_changed` |

**Server-side (Supabase live):** `netlify/functions/_shared/db.js` now exports `insertReadinessHistory()` and `listReadinessHistory()`. These are wired into `approve.js` and `opportunities.js`. History writes are non-fatal — failures log a warning and do not block the primary operation.

**Client-side (demo/localStorage):** `src/lib/api.js` `recordReadinessHistory()` is called at the same points.

**Supabase migration required:** `supabase/migrations/004_readiness_history.sql` (already present).

### Opportunity Detail — Activity Timeline

`OpportunityDetail.jsx` now shows a `ReadinessTimeline` component in the sidebar when history exists for the opportunity. Events are displayed newest first with icons, labels, from→to transitions, and dates.

### Offline Fallback

`public/offline.html` added — an honest offline page that explains live data is unavailable.

`public/sw.js` updated:
- Cache name bumped to `job-search-os-shell-v2` (busts old shell cache on upgrade)
- `/offline.html` added to `SHELL_ASSETS`
- Navigation requests now fall back to `/offline.html` when fully offline
- API strategy unchanged: Network Only

### Tracker — Readiness Group Filter

`src/pages/Tracker.jsx` now has a **Readiness Group** dropdown filter:
- State: `readinessFilter` / `setReadinessFilter`
- Options: All groups, Ready to Apply, Follow-up Due, Needs URL, Needs Approval, In Progress, Low Priority
- Uses `classifyReadinessGroup()` — same shared logic, no second engine

### n8n Workflow Assets

New workflow files added:

| File | Trigger | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `n8n/workflows/06-daily-approval-digest.json` | Daily schedule + manual | Fetches approval digest, formats summary |
| `n8n/workflows/07-weekly-readiness-summary.json` | Weekly schedule + manual | Fetches weekly digest with readiness counts |

Both use `$env.SITE_URL` for the Netlify URL. Neither re-implements business logic.
Discovery workflow (`05-job-discovery.json`) remains unchanged and requires `DISCOVERY_SECRET`.

### Verification

`scripts/verify.js` now has **520 tests** across **19 sections**.

Section 19 covers: Reports.jsx duplicate export fix, no other duplicate exports, readiness history wiring in api.js + approve.js + opportunities.js, OpportunityDetail timeline, db.js live path, sw.js offline fallback, offline.html, Tracker readiness filter, n8n workflow assets, readiness history logic, hierarchy guard, approval gate.

Run: `node scripts/verify.js`
